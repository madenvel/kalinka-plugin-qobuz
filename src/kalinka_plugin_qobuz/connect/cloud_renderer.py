"""Playing what the Qobuz app asks for, on Kalinka's renderer.

The cloud names a track and a state; this takes the server's output through
DirectPlayback and plays it, and reports back what is really playing so the
app follows. Controls pressed in Kalinka arrive as transport requests and are
applied here too, so both apps agree. When the server takes the output back,
the app is told playback stopped. The track that follows is lined up on the
renderer shortly before the current one ends, so it plays on without a gap.

Echo handling follows Pibuz: the cloud repeats every state report as a
SET_STATE naming no change, and right after a handoff replays a pause or stop
at the start of the track, neither of which may be acted on.
